# Food Attribute Classification System

This repository contains the implementation of a Food Attribute Classification system developed by Kavita Lamani. The system is designed to address the challenge of deciphering complex food labels and understanding nutritional information faced by consumers in today's fast-paced world.

## Abstract

In today's fast-paced world, consumers are increasingly concerned about the food they consume, seeking transparency and clarity regarding its attributes. However, deciphering complex food labels and understanding nutritional information can be challenging. This paper presents a solution to this problem through the development of a Food Attribute Classification system. Leveraging machine learning and natural language processing techniques, our system aims to accurately classify food attributes such as ingredients, nutritional content, allergens, and certifications from textual inputs such as food labels or descriptions. The proposed mobile application provides users with instant access to detailed information about food products, aiding them in making informed dietary choices. By enhancing consumer understanding and transparency in the food industry, our project addresses the growing demand for healthier and safer food options, ultimately contributing to improved public health outcomes and consumer satisfaction.
